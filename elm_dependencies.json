, "summary": "Experimental library for Generic Programming using records"
, "description":
      "This is a library for experimenting with generic programming in Elm using Elm's powerful record system. The functions in Generic.Fold generalize many common functions. The names (monoid/semigroup) are taken from mathematics, but I'm looking for less formal but still precise names. This library is intended to be lightweight and since monoids/semigroups are defined as type aliases, you can define your own instances without using this library."
